# Porkbun CDN Example

Perfect — I see the structure clearly in your current GitHub file (`gwas-cdn/porkbun/gwas-registered-tlds-buns.txt`) and your selection includes:

```
_actor.svg  
_agency.svg  
_ai.svg  
_app.svg  
_auction.svg  
_autos.svg
```

Let’s first build **Table 1: the text-only grouping by letter (A–Z)**
(using your current list of TLD SVGs).
Then we’ll generate **Table 2: the SVG-display table**, sized 50×50 pixels for embedding in your Google Sheet or Docs.
