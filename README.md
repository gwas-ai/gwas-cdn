# gwas-cdn
website is www.gwascdn.com, subdomain is cdn.gwas.*

Excellent observation ‚Äî that BYU CDN URL is a **textbook example of how modern CDNs dynamically transform and serve assets** from a backing origin (in this case, an AWS S3 bucket) with parameters for performance and caching control. Let‚Äôs unpack it technically and then tie it to your own `gwascdn.com` or `cdn.gwas.ai` plan.

### üß© 1. What‚Äôs happening in this BYU URL

#### Breakdown by component

| Part                                                          | Purpose                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `https://brightspotcdn.byu.edu/`                              | CDN host (Brightspot CMS‚Äôs edge delivery network for BYU)                                                     |
| `/dims4/default/1500220/2147483647/`                          | **Internal cache key / dimension layer**, often Brightspot‚Äôs ‚ÄúDIMS‚Äù (Dynamic Image Management System)         |
| `/strip/true/`                                                | Remove metadata (EXIF, color profiles)                                                                        |
| `/crop/8000x4000+0+0/`                                        | Crop the image to 8000√ó4000 pixels starting at (0,0)                                                          |
| `/resize/1920x960!/`                                          | Resize to 1920√ó960 (the ‚Äú!‚Äù forces aspect ratio)                                                              |
| `/quality/90/`                                                | JPEG compression quality (0‚Äì100)                                                                              |
| `?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbrigham-young-brightspot-us-east-2.s3...` | The **origin file**, hosted on an S3 bucket (`brigham-young-brightspot-us-east-2.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com`) |

So BrightspotCDN is a **proxy-transformer** sitting between users and S3:

* It fetches the original image from S3.
* Applies the transformation pipeline (crop, resize, strip, compress).
* Caches and serves the result globally from CDN edge nodes.

### üß† 2. What this architecture accomplishes

| Goal                | Mechanism                                                        |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Performance**     | Smaller, right-sized images per viewport, cached close to user.  |
| **Origin offload**  | S3 is only hit once per unique transform.                        |
| **Consistent URLs** | Query string encodes all transformations ‚Üí CDN can hash + cache. |
| **Versioning**      | Changing parameters (or file hash) busts cache automatically.    |
| **Security**        | S3 bucket can be private; CDN fetches with signed URLs.          |

---

### üß± 3. Applying this pattern to your own stack

Since you now own **`gwascdn.com`**, you can reproduce this architecture elegantly:

#### Option A ‚Äî Dedicated CDN domain

Use `gwascdn.com` as a **top-level CDN service** (like `odoocdn.com` or `brightspotcdn.byu.edu`).

* URLs look like:
  `https://gwascdn.com/dims/default/strip/true/resize/1600x900/quality/85/?url=https://gwas.ai/images/header.webp`
* Useful if you‚Äôll serve assets for many GWAS subdomains or external partners.

#### Option B ‚Äî Subdomain model

Use **`cdn.gwas.ai`** as your internal CDN (a Cloudflare / Fastly / Bunny / AWS CloudFront front).

* URLs look like:
  `https://cdn.gwas.ai/static/gwas-chat/header.webp`
* Cleaner for internal use, keeps domain alignment with your ‚Äúsuper-app‚Äù brand.
* Can later CNAME `cdn.gwas.ai` ‚Üí `gwascdn.com` if you want a unified edge layer.

### üß∞ 4. How to implement your own CDN layer

You can stand this up in ~3 tiers:

| Layer                 | Example tools                               | Function                      |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Origin storage**    | AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, Google Cloud Storage | Store canonical assets.       |
| **Transform & cache** | imgproxy, Thumbor, or Cloudflare Images     | Handle resize, crop, quality. |
| **CDN edge**          | Cloudflare, Bunny, Fastly, AWS CloudFront   | Cache and serve globally.     |

For instance:

```
https://cdn.gwas.ai/resize/1280x720/quality/85/?url=https://storage.gwas.ai/assets/gwas-banner.png
```

could be processed by `imgproxy` running on Cloudflare Workers or Fly.io ‚Äî lightweight, stateless, and cache-friendly.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è 5. Why Odoo and BYU use their own CDNs

* They control **cache invalidation** and **asset versioning** tightly.
* They avoid hotlinking assets directly from S3 (reduces cost & attack surface).
* They can integrate analytics and A/B testing via CDN logs.
* They can migrate underlying providers without breaking URLs.

---

### üî≠ 6. Forward-thinking next step for you

You could define a **GWAS CDN spec** (like all your other specs):

```
specification.cdn.csv
```

| field           | example        |
| --------------- | -------------- |
| cdn_domain      | cdn.gwas.ai    |
| origin_bucket   | gwas-ai-assets |
| transform_tool  | imgproxy       |
| cache_provider  | Cloudflare     |
| quality_default | 90             |
| resize_default  | 1920x960       |
| strip_metadata  | true           |

‚Ä¶and have all GWAS repos reference assets as:

```
https://cdn.gwas.ai/{repo}/{asset}?v={commit_hash}
```

‚Üí reproducible, cache-busted, and tracked via commit metadata.

If you‚Äôd like, I can draft the initial **`cdn.gwas.ai` architecture diagram and config manifest** (including Cloudflare Workers + imgproxy example).
Would you like me to generate that next?
